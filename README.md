## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There is no installation, just this Jupyter Notebook (Python 3.*) file:

- ["covid-19-death-rate.ipynb"](https://github.com/datacgi/covid-19-death-rate/blob/main/covid-19-death-rate.ipynb)

## About this Project<a name="motivation"></a>

This project originated from the Udacity's Nanodregree Data Science Program, to attend the activity "Write a Data Science Blog Post".

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on public health, economies, and governance worldwide. However, mortality rates have varied significantly from country to country, indicating that the effects of the virus are not solely biological but also influenced by societal structures. This study identifies five key aspects that play a crucial role in determining the death rate due to COVID-19: economy, corruption, education, health, and government regime. By analyzing these factors, we can better understand how different nations have responded to the pandemic and why some have faced higher mortality rates than others.

The proposal is to explain the following issues:

1. <b>Economic</b>: Do richer countries perform better against the virus than emerging ones?
2. <b>Corruption</b>: Do the most corrupt countries have more deaths?
3. <b>Health</b>: Are countries with the most investments in health coping better with the pandemic?
4. <b>Education</b>: Does the quality of education interfere with the death rate?
5. <b>Government</b>: Is democracy more prepared to save lives than authoritarian regimes?

Datasets available in this repository:

- ["covid.csv" (Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths (Our World in Data)](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths/)
- ["gdp.csv" (Gross domestic product — GDP (The World Bank)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
- ["cpi.csv" (Corruption Perception Index 2020 (Transparency International)](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/bra)
- ["edu.csv" (Education Index (Human Development Reports)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/103706)
- ["health.csv" (The 2021 STC Health Index (Hudson's Global Residence Index)](https://globalresidenceindex.com/hnwi-index/health-index/)
- ["demo.csv" (Democracy Index 2020 (The Economist Intelligence Unit)](https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2020/)

Through the notebook file, I answered the questions following the CRISP-DM Process (1. Understanding Business, 2. Understanding Data, 3. Preparing Data, 4. Modeling Data, 5. Evaluate the Results, and 6. Implement). You can find all analyzes of the data and the conclusion in the post (link below).  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

By analyzing the data from these five aspects (economy, education, health, corruption, and government regime), it was possible to analyze the correlations among countries, and understand the different mortality rates of COVID-19 in the world.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The application is only a Jupyter Notebook file (Python 3.*):

- ["covid-19-death-rate.ipynb"](https://github.com/datacgi/covid-19-death-rate/blob/main/covid-19-death-rate.ipynb)

## About this Project<a name="motivation"></a>

This project originated from the Udacity's Nanodregree Data Science Program, to attend the activity "Write a Data Science Blog Post".

The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) took the world by surprise and, despite the advances we have made in dealing with the virus, we still have a lot to learn. However, since last year, the world has produced countless data that can help us understand what is happening and why.

This study aims to scientifically understand the reason for the different mortality rates caused by COVID-19 globally, starting from the five main aspects that affect its lethality in the countries: economy, corruption, education, health, and government regime.

The proposal is to explain the following issues:

1. Economic: Do richer countries perform better against the virus than emerging ones?
2. Corruption: Do the most corrupt countries have more deaths?
3. Health: Are countries with the most investments in health coping better with the pandemic?
4. Education: Does the quality of education interfere with the death rate?
5. Government regime: Is democracy more prepared to save lives than authoritarian regimes?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Data files avaible in this repository:

- ["covid.csv" (Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths (Our World in Data)](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths/)
- ["gdp.csv" (Gross domestic product — GDP (The World Bank)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
- ["cpi.csv" (Corruption Perception Index 2020 (Transparency International)](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/bra)
- ["edu.csv" (Education Index (Human Development Reports)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/103706)
- ["health.csv" (The 2021 STC Health Index (Hudson's Global Residence Index)](https://globalresidenceindex.com/hnwi-index/health-index/)
- ["demo.csv" (Democracy Index 2020 (The Economist Intelligence Unit)](https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2020/)

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

By crossing and clustering the data of these five aspects of the countries (economy, education, health, corruption, and democracy), it was possible to find the correlations between them and, thus, understand the different mortality rates of the countries about COVID-19.

All the explanation and findings are available in my Medium account [https://datacgi.medium.com](https://datacgi.medium.com), at the folowing post:

I developed this project for the “Write a Data Science Blog Post,” my first project for Udacity’s Nanodegree Data Science Program. Thank Udacity for encouraging me to develop this work, my wife and daughter for giving me the support I need to study full time, and my teacher and friend Rodrigo Veloso for sharing his knowledge with me.

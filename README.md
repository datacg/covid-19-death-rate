## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## About this Project<a name="motivation"></a>

This project originated from the Udacity's Nanodregree Data Science Program, to attend the activity "Write a Data Science Blog Post".

The preliminary analysis will attempt to answer 3 questions about COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil:

1. What has been the proportional efficacy of vaccination in Brazil compared to the United States?
2. How many lives would have been saved if Brazil had adopted vaccination and preventive measures similar to those in the United States?
3. According to the actual Brazilian vaccination curve, how many people will die before the population is fully vaccinated? 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Data files avaible in this repository:

- "owid-covid-data.csv" (from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)).

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

Notebook Jupypter used to answer the questions:

- "owid-covid-data.ipynb"
